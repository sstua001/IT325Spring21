			<p> I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree at Old Dominion University. This link contains the <a href="https://catalog.odu.edu/undergraduate/stromecollegeofbusiness/bsbainfosystems/infosysandtech-bsba-fouryearplan/"> IT courses</a> I have to take. Additionally, my minor is Cyber Security. The link contains the <a href="https://catalog.odu.edu/undergraduate/schoolofcybersecurity/#cybersecurityinterdisciplinaryminortext"> Cybersecurity courses </a> I can take. I am in my Senior year with 6 courses left until I graduate. I am currently interested in Networks, Web Page development, and Security. I was pretty good at Programming and Databases but I do not enjoy them. After graduation, I hope to find a job in the private sector or public sector as a Network Administrator. At first, I was a Management major but quickly changed it to Marketing. A year ago, I changed my major again, due to not enjoying Marketing, to Information Technology. </p>

		<h2 style="color: DodgerBlue;"> Certifications </h2>
			<p> Some certifications I am planning on getting are: CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+. The only certification I have is the Google Analytics Certification. I am planning to get these because they relate to the jobs I am trying to pursue in the future. </p>
